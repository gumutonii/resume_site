                With a certificate in Internet of Things (IoT) and a series of diverse projects under my belt from high school, my experience in software development extends beyond the classroom. These projects have been the testing grounds where I've applied my skills in HTML, CSS, PHP, Bootstrap, and C++, delving into the world of IoT to create innovative solutions. From designing and implementing IoT devices to developing web interfaces for data visualization, each project has been a stepping stone in my journey. These experiences have not only deepened my technical expertise but have also taught me invaluable lessons in project management, collaboration, and problem-solving. My work in high school has prepared me to tackle real-world challenges in software engineering with confidence and creativity.
